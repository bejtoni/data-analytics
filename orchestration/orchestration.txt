The orchestration of the ETL pipeline will take place using the Windows Task Scheduler. The Task Scheduler will be configured to trigger a .bat script. This batch script will, in turn, execute a Python (.py) script located in this folder.

The Python script is responsible for running the specific task assigned for the incremental update of all necessary items in the system.

The incremental update ensures that only the newly added or modified records are processed, making the workflow efficient and reducing the load on the system.
